# Libraries
It's about the Machine Learning Libraries
## Essential libraries for Machine Learning in Python
Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.
One of Python’s greatest assets is its extensive set of libraries.Machine learning is largely based upon mathematics. Specifically, mathematical optimization, statistics and probability. Python libraries help researchers/mathematicians who are less equipped with developer knowledge to easily “do machine learning”.
### Below are some of the most commonly used libraries in machine learning:

# 1.Numpy (Numerical Python)
  It's the fundamental package for Numerical computation with Python,it contains a powerful N-dimensional array object.Numeric,the ancestor of numpy,was developed by JIM HUGUNIN.Another package Numarray was also developed having some additional functionalities.In 2005
  TRAVIS OLIPHANT created Numpy package by incorporating the features of numarray into Numeric package.
  NumPy = Numeric + Numarray

NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents. NumPy address the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops using NumPy.
