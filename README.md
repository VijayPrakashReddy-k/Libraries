# Libraries
It's about the Machine Learning Libraries
## Essential libraries for Machine Learning in Python
Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.
One of Python’s greatest assets is its extensive set of libraries.Machine learning is largely based upon mathematics. Specifically, mathematical optimization, statistics and probability. Python libraries help researchers/mathematicians who are less equipped with developer knowledge to easily “do machine learning”.
### Below are some of the most commonly used libraries in machine learning:

# 1.Numpy (Numerical Python)
  It's the fundamental package for Numerical computation with Python,it contains a powerful N-dimensional array object.Numeric,the ancestor of numpy,was developed by JIM HUGUNIN.Another package Numarray was also developed having some additional functionalities.In 2005
  TRAVIS OLIPHANT created Numpy package by incorporating the features of numarray into Numeric package.
  NumPy = Numeric + Numarray

NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents. NumPy address the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops using NumPy.

# 2.Pandas 
The name ‘Pandas’ is derived from the term “panel data”, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets.
Pandas is a very popular library that provides high-level data structures which are simple to use as well as intuitive.
It has many inbuilt methods for grouping, combining data and filtering as well as performing time series analysis.
Pandas can easily fetch data from different sources like SQL databases, CSV, Excel, JSON files and manipulate the data to perform operations on it. 
### There are two main structures in the library:

#### Series:
A Series is a one-dimensional object that can hold any data type such as integers, floats and strings. Let’s take a list of items as an input argument and create a Series object for that list.
#### DataFrame:
A DataFrame is a two dimensional object that can have columns with potential different types. Different kind of inputs include dictionaries, lists, series, and even another DataFrame.It is the most commonly used pandas object.
